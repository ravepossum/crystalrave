# CrystalShireEngine (CSE)

CrystalShireEngine (CSE) is an enhanced engine for Pokemon Crystal romhacking.

#### CSE is currently still **under developement**. You will likely experience significant bugs and differences in the engine compared to vanilla pokecrystal. If you wish to use CSE, we highly recommend you join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/dvpf6wcqMn) for support. We need your help to identify bugs, so we may improve the engine for everyone!
